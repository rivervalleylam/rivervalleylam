A business loan is a method of debt financing for a business that involves borrowing money from a lender to be paid back over time with interest. Business loans help entrepreneurs and business owners start and grow their businesses, cover gaps in cash flow, purchase new equipment and more.

There are many different types of business loans, including term loans, SBA loans, lines of credit and other types of alternative financing. The best fit for you will depend on your loan purpose, business history and personal financial history. Business loans, also sometimes called commercial loans, are generally issued by banks, credit unions, nonprofit lending organizations or online lenders.
